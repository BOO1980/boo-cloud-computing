    <h1>Cloud Computing Overview</h1>

    <h2>Infrastructure as a service</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is the most flexible category of cloud services</li>
        <li>It provides you the maxium amount of control for your cloud resources</li>
        <li>In an LaaS model, the cloud provider is responsible for maintaining the 
            <ul>
                <li>hardware</li>
                <li>network connectivity</li>
                <li>physical security</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Youre responsible for everything else
            <ul>
                <li>Operating system installation</li>
                <li>Configuration</li>
                <li>Maintenance</li>
                <li>Network Configuration</li>
                <li>Database and storage configuration</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>With IaaS, your essentially renting the hardware in a cloud datacenter</li>
        <li>With all the other cloud service types IaaS places the largest share of the responsibilty with you</li>
        <li>Some common scenarios where IaaS might make sense include
            <ul>
                <li>Lift and shift migration: Your'e standing up cloud resources similar to your on-prem datacenter, and then simily moving the things runnon on-prem to running on the IaaS infrastructure</li>
                <li>Testing and development: You have established configuration for development and test environments that you need too rapidly replicate, You can stand up  or shut down the different enviroments rapidly with an IaaS struture, while maintaining compelte control</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Platform as a Service</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Platform as a service (PaaS) is a middle ground between renting space in a datacenter (Infrastructure as a Service) and paying for a complete and deployed solution (Software as a Service).</li>
        <li>In a Paas environment the cloud provider maintains the physical infrastructure, physical securitym and connection to the internet</li>
        <li>They also maintain the operatinf systems, middleware, development tools and buisness intelligence services that make up a cloud solution</li>
        <li>In a Paas environment you dont have to worry about the licensing or patching for operating systems and databases</li>
        <li>Paas is well suited to provide a complete development enviroments without the headache of maintaining all the developemtn infrastructure</li>
        <li>In a PaaS splits the responsibilty between you and the cloud provider</li>
        <li>The cloud provider is responsible for maintiaing the physical infrastructure and its access to the internet</li>
        <li>Think of PaaS like using a domain joined machine: IT maintains the device with regular updates patches and refreshes</li>
        <li>Common scenarios where PaaS might make sense is <ul>
            <li>Development Framework: PaaS provides a framwork that developers can build upon to develop or customize cloud-based applications</li>
            <li>PaaS lets developers create applications using built in software components</li>
            <li>Analytics or business intelliegence: Tools provided as a service with PaaS allow organisations to analyze and mine their data, fnding insights, and patterns and predicting outcomes to improve forecasting, product design decisions, investment returns and other business decisions</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>
